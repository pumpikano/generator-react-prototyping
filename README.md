# generator-react-prototyping [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/pumpikano/generator-react-prototyping.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pumpikano/generator-react-prototyping)

> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for prototyping client-side javascript in ES6 powered by
> React, Webpack, Babel, ESLint, and Express.


## Getting Started

### What is react-prototyping?

react-prototyping creates a simple project for client-side javascript experimentation or writing React components. It uses Babel for compiling ES6, Webpack to build your project, React to template and run it, and Express to serve it. It is great for developing ES6 client-side javascript modules that are used in other projects but that need a convenient development environment.

### Installing

To install Yeoman if you don't already have it:

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

To install generator-react-prototyping from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-react-prototyping
```

Finally, run the generator to create your new project:

```bash
yo react-prototyping
```

### Usage

Once you've made a new project, write javascript to your hearts content. You can run your experiment by editing `components/App.jsx`. You can export your code in `index.js`.

Build and run your experiment with `npm run dev`.
